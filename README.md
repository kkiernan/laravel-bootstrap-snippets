# laravel-bootstrap-snippets
Sublime Text snippets for Laravel 5 + Bootstrap 3

These snippets are for my personal workflow and are meant as an addition to the [bs3-sublime-plugin](https://github.com/JasonMortonNZ/bs3-sublime-plugin) package by Jason Morton for Sublime Text, which I highly reccommend!

Unless you use Laravel and Bootstrap, these snippets are useless.
